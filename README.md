Hi, 
My name is Chris and I am a graduate of the Silesian University of Technology,
currently pursuing Masters in Informatics (IoT). 

I am heavily interested in gaming, 
GameDev industry, as well as embedded programming. 

My current technology stack includes:
-> C/C++ (FreeRTOS, Arduino, ESP-IDF, in near future Unreal Engine 5) 
-> Python (basics, NumPy, Tkniter, Threading) 

My next goals are to learn some C# (for Unity), Cloud computing, Java and possibly some
front-end to determime what is the best fit for me .
